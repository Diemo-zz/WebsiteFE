I inherited a embarressingly parallel simulation code which was written in Fortran90, and parallelised using MPI. Over the course of my PhD, I learnt (through necessity) how to program in Fortran 90, and how to program in parallel. Upon completion of my PhD, I knew that I did not want to remain in the field of astronomy. As such, I got a position where I was doing software development using Fortran.",
